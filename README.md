# landing-page
This is a repository for Project: Landing Page from The Odin Project.

This is a culmination of the Flexbox portion of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. 
It was a fun project. These types of layouts allows for flexibility of input of whatever a product/company/service might want to show clients.

This project was made with Google Chrome as its main browser display/support.
